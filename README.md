An assistant for a board game created by me.

It is a game where players are adventurers exploring the Zé Lutinho's Cave. A dangerous cave that hides a fortune in gold. The first player to bring 3 gold nuggets to Zé Lutinho will win the cave as a reward.

During the game, we have to draw some regions of the cave to create walls or place new cards, as well as draw the results of damage received by players and other things.

The purpose of this assistant is to make all these draws that we make with dices.

This is my first study committed to github and I intend to develop an App using Flutter to be the assistant of my game.
